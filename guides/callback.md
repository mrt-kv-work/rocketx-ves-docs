# Venezuela / VES: Callback

RocketX sends callbacks to the `callback_url` provided in the order or withdraw
request.

Callbacks are sent when the request status changes. If `callback_url` is not
provided, no callback is sent.

See [Statuses](./statuses.md) for status values and cancellation reason codes.

## Callback Request

RocketX sends a signed `POST` request to the partner callback URL.

```http
POST {callback_url}
Content-Type: application/json
PublicKey: merchant-public-key
Timestamp: 1754549516
Signature: generated-hmac-sha512-hex-string
```

The callback signature is generated with the same rule as API requests:

```text
Signature = HMAC-SHA512(private_key, Timestamp + raw_callback_body)
```

The partner should verify the signature using the raw callback body.

## Partner Response

Return HTTP `200` after the callback is processed.

Order callbacks accept any HTTP `2xx` response. Withdraw callbacks require
HTTP `200`; other status codes trigger a retry.

Failed callback requests, including timeouts, are retried up to 3 times.
The callback request timeout is 10 seconds.
